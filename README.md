# nlpie-vm

A Linux virtual machine with graphical interface containing BioMedICUS, NLP-TAB, AMICUS, and other relevant research software.

All component software is open-source and downloadable from GitHub. The intent of the VM is that everything works out of the box.

Users will need VM host software. We recommend VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/), which is free and cross platform.  
(Note also that some systems may need virtualization enabled in BIOS setup; VirtualBox will tell you if this is the case.)
